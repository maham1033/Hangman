# Hangman game 
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game built in Java using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. The game works by randomly selecting a word from a predefined list of words, which the player then has to guess by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a penalty, with the player losing a "life" until they either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.

The game starts by randomly selecting a word from the predefined list, and then displaying a series of blank spaces representing each letter of the word. The player is prompted to guess a letter, and the game will indicate whether the letter is present in the word or not. If the guess is correct, the corresponding blank space(s) will be filled in with the letter. If the guess is incorrect, the player will lose a life and a part of the hangman image will be displayed. The game continues until the player either correctly guesses the word or loses all of their lives.

The Hangman game is designed to be challenging and engaging, with a clear and intuitive user interface that makes it accessible to users of all levels of experience. It is a fun way to test your vocabulary and guessing skills, and it can also be used as a teaching tool to help students learn about string manipulation, conditional statements, and other key programming concepts.
